This project inolved me attempting to recreate a YT homepage. This project was sginfnicant in my development as a HTML/CSS programmer as it consolidated knowledge
on more complicated concepts such as the div element and flexboxes. Although I didn't finish it because I wanted to pivot to personal projects and consistency was difficult
my learning journey wouldn't have been accelerated without engaging in the project.
